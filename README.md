Chess
=====
![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/Newbrict/Chess.svg?branch=master)

I've decided to stop working on this, it's a near-fully functional
client side chess engine ( just missing what's mentioned on the issues ) written
in coffeescript.

If there's any interest I will continue, otherwise other things will be made :)
